## E-commerce Platform POC
## Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an E-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The platform is designed to manage product catalogs, handle orders, and authenticate users. It leverages a robust tech stack including Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL.

## Tech Stack
1 Java

2 Spring Boot

3 Spring Data JPA

4 PostgreSQL

## Microservices

## 1. Product Catalog Service
# Description: Manages product details, including categories, prices, inventory, and descriptions.

# Endpoints:

1 GET /products - List all products

2 GET /products/{id} - Get a product by ID

3 POST /products - Add a new product

4 PUT /products/{id} - Update a product

5 DELETE /products/{id} - Delete a product

# 12-Factor Practices:

1 Codebase: A single codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.

2 Dependencies: Use Maven/Gradle for dependency management.

3 Config: Externalize configurations using Spring Cloud Config.

4 Backing Services: Use a managed PostgreSQL service.

5 Build, Release, Run: Use CI/CD pipelines.

6 Processes: Stateless and scalable processes.

7 Port Binding: Spring Bootâ€™s embedded Tomcat for serving.

8 Concurrency: Scale out by running multiple instances.

9 Disposability: Fast startup and graceful shutdown.

10 Dev/Prod Parity: Maintain similar environments for development, staging, and production.

11 Logs: Use a centralized logging system like Prometheus, ELK stack.

12 Admin Processes: Use Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring.

## 2. Order Management Service
# Description: Handles the creation, updating, and tracking of orders.

# Endpoints:

1 POST /orders - Create a new order

2 GET /orders/{id} - Get order details by ID

3 PUT /orders/{id} - Update an order

4 DELETE /orders/{id} - Cancel an order
# 12-Factor Practices: Similar to the Product Catalog Service

## 3. User Authentication Service
Description: Manages user registration, login, and authentication.

# Endpoints:

POST /auth/register - Register a new user
POST /auth/login - User login
GET /auth/user - Get authenticated user details

# Tech Stack:

1 Java

2 Spring Boot

3 Spring Security

4 JWT

# 12-Factor Practices:

1 Config: Manage sensitive information securely (e.g., secrets, tokens).

2 Security: Implement OAuth2 and JWT for secure authentication.

3 Isolation: Isolate sensitive operations and data.

# General Best Practices
1 Service Discovery:  Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka or Consul.

2 API Gateway: Use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and filtering.

3 Circuit Breaker: Implement with Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker or Resilience4j.

4 Tracing: Distributed tracing with Zipkin or Spring Cloud Sleuth.

5 Containerization: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

6 Monitoring: Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher
Maven or Gradle
Docker
Kubernetes (optional for orchestration)

# Installation
1 Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mithun1508/e-commerce.git
cd ecommerce-platform-poc

2 Build the project:
mvn clean install

3 Run the services:
java -jar product-catalog-service/target/product-catalog-service.jar
java -jar order-management-service/target/order-management-service.jar
java -jar user-authentication-service/target/user-authentication-service.jar

# Docker
To run the services using Docker:

1 Build Docker images:
docker build -t product-catalog-service ./product-catalog-service
docker build -t order-management-service ./order-management-service
docker build -t user-authentication-service ./user-authentication-service

2 Run Docker containers:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 product-catalog-service
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 order-management-service
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 user-authentication-service

# Kubernetes
To deploy the services using Kubernetes:

1 Apply Kubernetes manifests:
kubectl apply -f k8s/
