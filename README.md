# E-commerce Platform POC
# Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an E-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The platform is designed to manage product catalogs, handle orders, and authenticate users. It leverages a robust tech stack including Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL.

# Tech Stack
1 Java

2 Spring Boot

3 Spring Data JPA

4 PostgreSQL

# Microservices

# 1. Product Catalog Service
## Description: 
   Manages product details, including categories, prices, inventory, and descriptions.

## Endpoints:

1 GET /products - List all products

2 GET /products/{id} - Get a product by ID

3 POST /products - Add a new product

4 PUT /products/{id} - Update a product

5 DELETE /products/{id} - Delete a product

## 12-Factor Practices:

1 Codebase: A single codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.

2 Dependencies: Use Maven/Gradle for dependency management.

3 Config: Externalize configurations using Spring Cloud Config.

4 Backing Services: Use a managed PostgreSQL service.

5 Build, Release, Run: Use CI/CD pipelines.

6 Processes: Stateless and scalable processes.

7 Port Binding: Spring Bootâ€™s embedded Tomcat for serving.

8 Concurrency: Scale out by running multiple instances.

9 Disposability: Fast startup and graceful shutdown.

10 Dev/Prod Parity: Maintain similar environments for development, staging, and production.

11 Logs: Use a centralized logging system like Prometheus, ELK stack.

12 Admin Processes: Use Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring.

# 2. Order Management Service
## Description:
  Handles the creation, updating, and tracking of orders.

## Endpoints:

1 POST /orders - Create a new order

2 GET /orders/{id} - Get order details by ID

3 PUT /orders/{id} - Update an order

4 DELETE /orders/{id} - Cancel an order
## 12-Factor Practices: Similar to the Product Catalog Service

# 3. User Authentication Service
## Description: 
   Manages user registration, login, and authentication.

## Endpoints:

1 POST /auth/register - Register a new user

2 POST /auth/login - User login

3 GET /auth/user - Get authenticated user details

## Tech Stack:

1 Java

2 Spring Boot

3 Spring Security

4 JWT

## 12-Factor Practices:

1 Config: Manage sensitive information securely (e.g., secrets, tokens).

2 Security: Implement OAuth2 and JWT for secure authentication.

3 Isolation: Isolate sensitive operations and data.

## General Best Practices
1 Service Discovery:  Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka or Consul.

2 API Gateway: Use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and filtering.

3 Circuit Breaker: Implement with Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker or Resilience4j.

4 Tracing: Distributed tracing with Zipkin or Spring Cloud Sleuth.

5 Containerization: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

6 Monitoring: Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
1 Java 11 or higher

2 Maven or Gradle

3 Docker

4 Kubernetes (optional for orchestration)

# Installation
## Clone the repository:

1 git clone https://github.com/Mithun1508/e-commerce.git

2 cd ecommerce-platform-poc

## Build the project:

mvn clean install

## Run the services:

java -jar product-catalog-service/target/product-catalog-service.jar

java -jar order-management-service/target/order-management-service.jar

java -jar user-authentication-service/target/user-authentication-service.jar

## Docker
To run the services using Docker:

## Build Docker images:

docker build -t product-catalog-service ./product-catalog-service

docker build -t order-management-service ./order-management-service

docker build -t user-authentication-service ./user-authentication-service

## Run Docker containers:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 product-catalog-service

docker run -d -p 8081:8081 order-management-service

docker run -d -p 8082:8082 user-authentication-service

## Kubernetes

To deploy the services using Kubernetes:

 Apply Kubernetes manifests:
 
kubectl apply -f k8s/
